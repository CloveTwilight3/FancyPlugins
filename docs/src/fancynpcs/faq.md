# FAQ

### Does FancyNpcs support Shopkeepers?

- There is no official integration or addon for Shopkeepers
- But you can use the "/shopkeeper remote" as console_command actions
- Example `/npc action MY_NPC any_click add console_command shopkeeper remote SHOPKEEPER_ID {player}`
- SHOPKEEPER_ID: the display name of the shopkeeper

### Does FancyNpcs support ModelEngine 4?

No, currently there is no support for ModelEngine 4 or any other model engine. Since this is a highly requested feature, it might be added in the future (no promises or estimates). Keep an eye on the discord server for updates.

### Can I make the npc move?

FancyNpcs does not have a movement system yet. This is a highly requested feature and might be added in the future. Keep an eye on the discord server for updates.

We already made plans for a waypoint system, but it is not yet implemented. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to share them on the discord server.
