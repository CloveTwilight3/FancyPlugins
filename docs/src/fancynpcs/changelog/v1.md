**Server and player commands**

The subcommand "/npc command <npc name> <command>" has been replaced by two new subcommands:

- /npc serverCommand <npc name> <command>
- /npc playerCommand <npc name> <command>

The serverCommand will be executed by the console (as if you typed a command in the console). You can also include the `{player}` placeholder there.<br>
Example: `/npc serverCommand testNpc say Hello, {player}!`<br>
If I now interact with the testNpc, it will show "[Server] Hello, OliverHD!".

The playerCommand will be executed by the player (as if the player executed the command).<br>
Example: `/npc playerCommand testNpc warp pvp`<br>
If I now interact with the testNpc, I will get teleported to the pvp warp.
