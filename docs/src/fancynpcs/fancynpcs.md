- **Glowing** (in all colors)
- **Equipment** (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots, Hand and Offhand)
- **Interact** (Commands, Messages, Actions)
- **Attributes** (Pose, Variants, Visibility, etc.)

## Principles

### Simple

The plugin is designed to be easy to use and understand. The commands are well-structured and the tab completion is incredibly helpful.
You can do everything in-game without the need of touching the configuration files.
All commands and features are documented in this wiki. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the Discord server, we are happy to help you.

### Lightweight

The plugin is optimized for performance. It uses packets to send the npc data to the clients, which is the most efficient way to do it.
The server does not have to do any additional work, which means that the plugin has a minimal impact on the server performance.
FancyNpcs does not require ANY dependencies other than Paper.

### Feature-rich

The plugin has a lot of features to offer. You can customize the NPCs in many ways and create unique NPCs for your server.
