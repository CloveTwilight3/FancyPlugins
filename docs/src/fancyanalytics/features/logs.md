# Logs (soon)

Our analytics platform supports **structured logging** â€” a powerful way to capture detailed logs with context for debugging, monitoring, and analysis.
Structured logs go beyond plain text by capturing logs in a **machine-readable, structured format** with support for levels, timestamps, and custom properties.

## ðŸ’¡ What is a Structured Log?

A **structured log** is:

- A **timestamped message**
- With a **log level** (e.g. `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`)
- And **optional structured properties** (key-value pairs)

This makes logs **queryable**, **filterable**, and easy to **analyze programmatically**.
