There are multiple ways to send data to FancyAnalytics.

!!! danger
The FancyAnalytics platform is still in development. Expect breaking changes in the future.
!!!

### For Minecraft servers

If you run a Minecraft server, you might want to track metrics about your players and server performance. 
We provide a Minecraft plugin which can be installed on your server to send data to FancyAnalytics.
See the [Minecraft Servers](minecraft-servers.md) page for more information.

### For Minecraft plugins

If you are a Minecraft plugin developer, you might want to track metrics about your plugin usage.
So you know how many people are using your plugin and how they are using it.
We provide a Java SDK which is specifically designed for Minecraft plugins.
See the [Minecraft Plugins](minecraft-plugins.md) page for more information.

### For Java developers

If you are a Java developer, who wants to track metrics about your Java application, without being in the Minecraft ecosystem, you can use our Java SDK.
The Java SDK is a general purpose SDK which can be used to track metrics about any Java application.
See the [Java SDK](java-sdk.md) page for more information.

### For everyone else

If you are not a Java developer, or you are using a different programming language, you can use our REST API to send data to FancyAnalytics.
See the [REST API](rest-api.md) page for more information.
