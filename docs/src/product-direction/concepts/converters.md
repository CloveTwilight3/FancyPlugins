# Converters

There should be converters for other popular npc / hologram plugins to our plugin. 
This means, you can convert your npcs from other plugins to FancyNpcs (the same with holograms and FancyHolograms). 
This is a very important feature, as it allows users to easily migrate their existing npcs and holograms to our plugin without having to recreate them from scratch.

It should not be required to have the other plugin still installed to use the converter - it should be able to read the data from the other plugin's files and convert it to our format.

## Example Converters

The following lists are not complete, but they are examples of what we could do.

Npcs:
- Citizens to FancyNpcs
- ZNPCs to FancyNpcs


Holograms:
- DecentHolograms to FancyHolograms (already implemented)
- HolographicDisplays to FancyHolograms
