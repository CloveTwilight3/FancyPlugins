# Command Changes

Some commands need to be refactored to be more consistent with the new system.

## turn_to_player and turn_to_player_distance

These commands should be merged into a single command with two subcommands.

- `/npc turn_to_player <npc> enabled (state)`
- `/npc turn_to_player <npc> distance (distance)`
