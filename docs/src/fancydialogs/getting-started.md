After downloading the plugin, you can install it by placing the downloaded file in the `plugins` folder of your server.

Restart your server and you are ready to go!

To check if the plugin is installed correctly, you can use the command `/fancydialogs version`. If the plugin is installed correctly, it will show you the version of the plugin.

## Create your first dialog

FancyDialogs come with some default dialogs, which you can use to get started. You can find them in the `plugins/FancyDialogs/data/dialogs` folder. 
You can also create your own dialogs by creating a new file in this folder.

FancyDialogs uses a simple JSON format to define dialogs. Read the [JSON Schema](tutorials/json-schema.md) tutorial to learn more about the format.
