# JSON Schema

In this tutorial, we will explore the JSON schema used by FancyDialogs to define dialogs. 
This schema provides a structured way to create fancy dialogs.

## Example Dialog

The easiest way to create a new dialog is to copy an existing dialog and modify it to suit your needs.
You can find some example dialogs in the `plugins/FancyDialogs/data/dialogs` folder on your server.

Below is an example of a simple dialog defined using the FancyDialogs JSON schema:

```json
{
  "id": "my_dialog",
  "title": "My Fancy Dialog",
  "canCloseWithEscape": true,
  "body": [
    { "text": "This is my first dialog created with FancyDialogs!" }
  ],
  "inputs": {
    "textFields": [
      {
        "key": "fav_color",
        "order": 1,
        "label": "<color:#ff7300>What is your favorite color?</color>",
        "placeholder": "gold",
        "maxLength": 50,
        "maxLines": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "buttons": [
    {
      "label": "Show favorite color",
      "tooltip": "Click to show your favorite color",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "message",
          "data": "Your favorite color is: <color:{fav_color}>{fav_color}</color>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
